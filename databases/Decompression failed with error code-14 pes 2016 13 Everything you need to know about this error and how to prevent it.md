## What Causes Decompression Failed with Error Code-14 PES 2016 13?
 
The error code-14 means that the decompression process of the game files has failed due to some reason. This can happen because of several factors, such as:
 
- Corrupted or incomplete game files. This can occur if you downloaded the game from an unreliable source, or if the download was interrupted or incomplete.
- Insufficient disk space. The game requires about 9 GB of free space to install properly. If you don't have enough space on your drive, the decompression process will fail.
- Antivirus or firewall interference. Some antivirus or firewall programs may block or delete some game files during the installation process, causing the decompression to fail.
- Outdated or incompatible drivers. If your drivers are not updated or compatible with the game, they may cause conflicts or errors during the installation process.

## How to Fix Decompression Failed with Error Code-14 PES 2016 13?
 
Depending on the cause of the error, there are different solutions that you can try to fix it. Here are some of the most common and effective ones:

1. Verify the integrity of the game files. If you downloaded the game from a reliable source, such as Steam, you can use the built-in feature to verify the integrity of the game files. This will check if any files are missing or corrupted and replace them if needed. To do this, follow these steps:
    - Open Steam and go to your library.
    - Right-click on PES 2016 and select Properties.
    - Go to the Local Files tab and click on Verify Integrity of Game Files.
    - Wait for the process to complete and then try to install the game again.
2. Free up some disk space. If you don't have enough free space on your drive, you need to delete some unnecessary files or move them to another location. You can also use a disk cleanup tool to remove temporary files and other junk data. To do this, follow these steps:
    - Open File Explorer and go to This PC.
    - Right-click on the drive where you want to install the game and select Properties.
    - Click on Disk Cleanup and select the files that you want to delete.
    - Click on OK and then on Delete Files.
    - Wait for the process to complete and then try to install the game again.
3. Disable or uninstall your antivirus or firewall. If your antivirus or firewall is blocking or deleting some game files during the installation process, you need to disable or uninstall it temporarily. You can also add an exception for the game folder in your antivirus or firewall settings. To do this, follow these steps:
    - Open your antivirus or firewall program and go to its settings.
    - Look for an option to disable or turn off the program temporarily.
    - If there is no such option, look for an option to add an exception or whitelist for a specific folder.
    - Add the game folder as an exception or whitelist it.
    - Save the changes and then try to install the game again.
4. Update or reinstall your drivers. If your drivers are outdated or incompatible with the game, you need to update them to the latest version or reinstall
