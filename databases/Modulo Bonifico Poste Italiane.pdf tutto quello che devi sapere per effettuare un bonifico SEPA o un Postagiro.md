A postal transfer is a way of sending money from your BancoPosta account or your Postepay card with IBAN to another account within the SEPA area. SEPA stands for Single Euro Payments Area and includes 36 countries in Europe. You can use a postal transfer to pay bills, rent, taxes, or send money to your friends and family.
 
To fill out the form for a postal transfer, you need to download the PDF file from the Poste Italiane website[^1^] or get a paper copy from a post office. The form has different sections that you need to complete with your personal and banking information, as well as the details of the recipient and the amount of money you want to send.

Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Choose the type of transfer you want to make by marking with an "X" one of the options: "single order", "permanent order", or "complementary pension". A single order is a one-time payment, a permanent order is a recurring payment with a fixed amount and frequency, and a complementary pension is a payment for a retirement plan with Poste Italiane.
2. Fill in your personal information: name, surname, address, phone number, email, tax code, and signature. You also need to provide your BancoPosta account number or your Postepay card number and IBAN.
3. Fill in the recipient's information: name, surname, address, phone number, email, tax code, and IBAN. If the recipient has a BancoPosta account or a Postepay card, you can also write their account number or card number.
4. Fill in the amount of money you want to send in euros and write it both in numbers and words. For example: 100.00 (one hundred euros).
5. Fill in the reason for the payment. This is optional but it can help you keep track of your transactions. For example: rent, electricity bill, birthday gift, etc.
6. Fill in the date of execution of the payment. This is the date when you want the money to be transferred from your account to the recipient's account. You can choose any date within 30 days from the date of filling out the form.
7. If you chose a permanent order, you also need to fill in the frequency of the payment (monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, etc.) and the expiration date of the order.

Once you have completed the form, you can submit it at any post office or online through the Poste Italiane website[^2^] or app. You will need your debit card or Postepay card and your PIN code to authorize the payment. You will also receive a receipt with a reference number that you can use to check the status of your transfer.
 
The cost and time of execution of a postal transfer depend on the country of destination and the mode of submission. You can find more information on the Poste Italiane website[^2^].
