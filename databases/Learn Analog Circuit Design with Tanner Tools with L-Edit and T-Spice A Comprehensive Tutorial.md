Tanner Tools is a suite of software tools for analog mixed-signal (AMS) IC design. It includes S-Edit for schematic capture, L-Edit for physical layout, and T-Spice for circuit simulation. In this article, we will show you how to use these tools to create and verify a simple AMS IC design.
 
## S-Edit: Schematic Capture
 
S-Edit is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that allows you to draw and edit schematics of your AMS IC design. You can use S-Edit to create hierarchical schematics, add components from libraries, connect nets and buses, assign parameters and attributes, and run simulations. S-Edit supports industry standards such as OpenAccess, iPDK, TCL, HSPICE, PSpice, Verilog, and CDL.

To start S-Edit, go to Start > All Programs > Tanner EDA > Tanner Tools v12.6 > S-Edit v12.6. You will see a blank schematic window where you can draw your circuit. For example, let's create a simple inverter circuit using a PMOS and an NMOS transistor. To add a component, go to Edit > Add Component or click on the Add Component icon on the toolbar. A dialog box will appear where you can select the library and the component you want to add. For example, select the tsmc018 library and the pmos4 component. Click OK and place the component on the schematic window. Repeat the same steps to add an nmos4 component.
 
To connect the components, go to Edit > Add Wire or click on the Add Wire icon on the toolbar. Click on the terminals of the components you want to connect and press Enter to finish the wire. You can also use buses to group multiple wires together. To add a bus, go to Edit > Add Bus or click on the Add Bus icon on the toolbar. Click on the terminals of the components you want to group and press Enter to finish the bus. You can also use labels to name your nets and buses. To add a label, go to Edit > Add Label or click on the Add Label icon on the toolbar. Click on the net or bus you want to label and type in the name.
 
To assign parameters and attributes to your components, go to Edit > Properties or double-click on the component you want to modify. A dialog box will appear where you can change the values of various parameters and attributes such as width, length, area, model name, etc. You can also use expressions to define parameter values based on other parameters or variables.
 
To run simulations using T-Spice, go to Simulation > Run Simulation or click on the Run Simulation icon on the toolbar. A dialog box will appear where you can select the simulation type (DC, AC, Transient, etc.), analysis options (sweeping, Monte Carlo, etc.), output variables (voltage, current, power, etc.), and simulation settings (temperature, tolerances, etc.). Click OK and wait for the simulation to finish. You can view the simulation results using Tanner Waveform Viewer.
 
## L-Edit: Physical Layout
 
L-Edit is a GUI tool that allows you to create and edit physical layouts of your AMS IC design. You can use L-Edit to draw shapes and polygons representing different layers of your IC design such as metal, polysilicon, diffusion, etc. You can also use layout generators to automatically create layouts based on your schematic or netlist. L-Edit supports industry standards such as OpenAccess, SDL (Schematic Driven Layout), Calibre DRC/LVS/XRC (Design Rule Checking/Layout Versus Schematic/Parasitic Extraction), etc.
 
To start L-Edit, go to Start > All Programs > Tanner EDA > Tanner Tools v12.6 > L-Edit v12.6. You will see a blank layout window where you can draw your layout. For example, let's create a simple layout for our inverter circuit using tsmc018 technology. To add a shape or polygon representing a layer of your layout, go to Edit > Add Shape or click on the Add Shape icon on the toolbar. A dialog box will appear where you can select the layer name and type (rectangle, circle, polygon,
